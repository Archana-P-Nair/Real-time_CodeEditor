# Whiteboard Flickering Fix

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Reduced Update Frequency**
- Increased debounce time from 100ms to 300ms
- Added timing mechanism to prevent updates more frequent than 100ms
- Added delay in socket event handling to prevent rapid updates

### 2. **Improved State Management**
- Added `isUpdatingFromSocket` flag to prevent drawing during socket updates
- Added `lastUpdateTime` to track update frequency
- Prevent drawing when receiving socket updates

### 3. **Better Event Handling**
- Skip socket updates when currently drawing
- Skip updates if they're too frequent (< 100ms apart)
- Added small delays to prevent flickering

### 4. **Optimized Rendering**
- Improved React keys for better re-rendering
- Better memoization of rendered components

## How to Test:

1. **Start both servers:**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd prokect-main/backend && npm run dev
   
   # Frontend
   cd prokect-main/frontend && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test with two browser tabs:**
   - Open two tabs to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Join the same room in both tabs
   - Draw on one tab and observe the other

## Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Real-time synchronization still works
- ✅ No more flickering or static behavior
- ✅ Smooth drawing experience
- ✅ Reduced console spam
- ✅ Better performance

## If Still Flickering:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify both users are in the same room
3. Try refreshing both browser tabs
4. Check network tab for WebSocket connection issues

## Debug Information:
The console will show:
- "Skipping update - currently drawing or too frequent" (good)
- "Whiteboard state updated from socket" (normal)
- Connection status and room information
