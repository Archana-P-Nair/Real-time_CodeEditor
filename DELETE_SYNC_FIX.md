# Fix for Delete/Clear Canvas Real-time Sync

## Problem:
The delete/clear canvas operation was blinking and not working properly in real-time. It would appear briefly but then disappear or not sync to other users.

## Root Cause:
1. **Timing conflicts** between clear operation and other sync mechanisms
2. **State flag conflicts** - `isUpdatingFromSocket` wasn't properly managed during clear operations
3. **Delayed application** of clear operations causing blinking effect

## Solution Applied:

### **1. Improved Clear Canvas Operation:**
```javascript
const clearCanvas = useCallback(() => {
  // Set updating flag to prevent conflicts
  setIsUpdatingFromSocket(true);
  
  setLines([]);
  setTextBoxes([]);
  setShapes([]);
  setCurrentLine(null);
  setCurrentShape(null);
  
  // Immediately sync clear operation to other users
  if (socket && roomId) {
    console.log('Syncing clear canvas operation:', { roomId });
    setTimeout(() => {
      socket.emit('whiteboard-update', { 
        lines: [], 
        textBoxes: [], 
        shapes: [], 
        roomId 
      });
      // Reset the flag after sync
      setTimeout(() => {
        setIsUpdatingFromSocket(false);
      }, 100);
    }, 200);
  } else {
    setIsUpdatingFromSocket(false);
  }
  
  saveState();
}, [saveState, socket, roomId]);
```

### **2. Enhanced Socket Event Handling:**
- **Detect clear operations** by checking if all arrays are empty
- **Apply clear operations immediately** without delay to prevent blinking
- **Apply other operations with delay** to prevent conflicts

```javascript
// Check if this is a clear operation (all arrays are empty)
const isClearOperation = (data.lines?.length === 0 && data.textBoxes?.length === 0 && data.shapes?.length === 0);

if (isClearOperation) {
  console.log('Processing clear operation from socket');
  // For clear operations, apply immediately without delay
  setLines([]);
  setTextBoxes([]);
  setShapes([]);
  setIsUpdatingFromSocket(false);
} else {
  // Use a longer delay to prevent conflicts with local updates
  setTimeout(() => {
    setLines(data.lines || []);
    setTextBoxes(data.textBoxes || []);
    setShapes(data.shapes || []);
    setIsUpdatingFromSocket(false);
  }, 100);
}
```

### **3. Improved Undo/Redo Operations:**
- Added proper state flag management
- Better conflict prevention
- Enhanced logging for debugging

## How to Test:

1. **Refresh both browser tabs** to get the latest code
2. **Join the same room** in both tabs
3. **Test delete operations:**

### **Clear Canvas Testing:**
- Draw some shapes and text in both tabs
- Click the trash/delete icon in one tab
- Canvas should clear **immediately** in both tabs
- **No blinking** or flickering should occur

### **Undo/Redo Testing:**
- Draw some content in one tab
- Use undo in one tab - should undo in both tabs
- Use redo in one tab - should redo in both tabs
- **No conflicts** with clear operations

## Expected Results:
- ✅ **Clear canvas works instantly** in both tabs
- ✅ **No blinking or flickering** during clear operations
- ✅ **Undo/redo operations sync properly** without conflicts
- ✅ **All delete operations are real-time** and stable

## Debug Information:
Check browser console for:
- "Syncing clear canvas operation: {roomId: 'test123'}"
- "Processing clear operation from socket"
- "Syncing undo/redo operation: {lines: 0, textBoxes: 0, shapes: 0, roomId: 'test123'}"

The delete/clear canvas operation should now work **perfectly in real-time** without any blinking or conflicts!
