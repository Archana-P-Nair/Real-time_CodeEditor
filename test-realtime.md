# Real-time Functionality Test Guide

## How to Test Real-time Whiteboard and Output Synchronization

### Prerequisites
1. Make sure both frontend and backend servers are running
2. Open two browser windows/tabs to simulate two users

### Testing Steps

#### 1. Start the Servers
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd prokect-main/backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd prokect-main/frontend
npm run dev
```

#### 2. Test Whiteboard Real-time Sync
1. **User 1**: Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Create a room with username "User1"
   - Start drawing on the whiteboard (lines, shapes, text)
   - Observe the drawing appears

2. **User 2**: Open another browser tab to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Join the same room with username "User2"
   - Should see User1's existing drawings immediately
   - Start drawing - User1 should see User2's drawings in real-time

#### 3. Test Code Editor Real-time Sync
1. **User 1**: In the code editor
   - Type some code
   - Change the programming language
   - Run the code to see output

2. **User 2**: Should see
   - Code changes appear in real-time
   - Language changes sync immediately
   - Output appears when User1 runs code

#### 4. Test Output Generation Real-time Sync
1. **User 1**: Write and run code
   - The output should appear in both users' output panels
   - Any errors should also sync

2. **User 2**: 
   - Can also run code and both users see the output
   - Output updates in real-time for both users

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ Whiteboard drawings sync in real-time between users
- ✅ Code changes appear instantly for all users
- ✅ Language changes sync immediately
- ✅ Code execution output appears for all users
- ✅ Users can see each other in the user list
- ✅ Room state persists when users join/leave

### Troubleshooting
- Check browser console for WebSocket connection errors
- Verify backend server is running on port 3001
- Ensure both users are in the same room
- Check network connectivity

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Real-time Whiteboard Synchronization**
   - Drawing strokes sync instantly
   - Shapes and text boxes sync
   - Undo/redo operations sync
   - Canvas state persistence

2. **Real-time Code Editor Synchronization**
   - Code changes sync in real-time
   - Language selection syncs
   - Cursor position and selections sync

3. **Real-time Output Synchronization**
   - Code execution results sync
   - Error messages sync
   - Output formatting preserved

4. **Room Management**
   - Users can create and join rooms
   - User list updates in real-time
   - Room state persists across sessions
