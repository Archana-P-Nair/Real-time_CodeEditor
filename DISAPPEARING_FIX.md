# Fix for Disappearing Shapes/Text Issue

## Problem:
Shapes and text boxes were appearing for 1-2 seconds but then disappearing. This was caused by conflicting socket updates overriding each other.

## Root Cause:
Multiple socket update mechanisms were conflicting:
1. **Immediate sync** (100ms delay) - for new shapes/text
2. **Debounced sync** (300ms delay) - for general state changes  
3. **SaveState sync** (300ms delay) - for history operations
4. **useEffect sync** (200ms delay) - for state changes

These were sending updates at different times, causing the latest update to override the previous one.

## Solution Applied:

### **1. Unified Timing:**
- **Immediate sync**: Increased from 100ms to 200ms
- **Debounced sync**: Increased from 300ms to 500ms
- **useEffect sync**: Increased from 200ms to 500ms
- **Socket event handling**: Increased delay from 50ms to 100ms

### **2. Better Conflict Prevention:**
- Increased minimum time between updates from 100ms to 200ms
- Longer delays prevent rapid-fire updates that override each other
- Better coordination between different sync mechanisms

### **3. Improved State Management:**
- Socket updates now wait longer before applying changes
- Prevents local updates from being immediately overridden
- Better handling of concurrent operations

## How to Test:

1. **Refresh both browser tabs** to get the latest code
2. **Join the same room** in both tabs
3. **Test each feature:**

### **Shape Testing:**
- Draw rectangles, circles, lines in one tab
- They should appear and **stay visible** in the other tab

### **Text Testing:**
- Add text boxes in one tab
- Edit, move, resize text boxes
- All changes should appear and **persist** in the other tab

### **Canvas Testing:**
- Use clear canvas, undo/redo operations
- Changes should sync and **remain stable**

## Expected Results:
- ✅ **Shapes appear and stay visible** (no more disappearing)
- ✅ **Text boxes persist** after creation/editing
- ✅ **All operations sync reliably** without conflicts
- ✅ **Stable real-time collaboration** across all features

## Debug Information:
Check browser console for:
- "Syncing shape creation: {shapes: 1, roomId: 'test123'}"
- "Syncing text box creation: {textBoxes: 1, roomId: 'test123'}"
- "Whiteboard state updated from socket"
- "Skipping update - currently drawing or too frequent" (good)

The whiteboard should now be **fully stable** with all features working reliably in real-time!
