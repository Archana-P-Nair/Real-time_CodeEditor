# Fix for Permanent Delete/Clear Canvas Issue

## Problem:
The delete/clear canvas operation was only working for 2 seconds and then the content was coming back. This was caused by conflicting sync mechanisms overriding the clear operation.

## Root Cause:
1. **Debounced sync mechanisms** were overriding the clear operation
2. **useEffect sync** was re-sending old state after clear operation
3. **saveState function** was triggering additional syncs that restored content
4. **No proper flag management** to prevent conflicts during clear operations

## Solution Applied:

### **1. Added Clearing State Flag:**
```javascript
const [isClearing, setIsClearing] = useState(false);
```

### **2. Enhanced Clear Canvas Operation:**
```javascript
const clearCanvas = useCallback(() => {
  // Set flags to prevent conflicts
  setIsUpdatingFromSocket(true);
  setIsClearing(true);
  
  setLines([]);
  setTextBoxes([]);
  setShapes([]);
  setCurrentLine(null);
  setCurrentShape(null);
  
  // Immediately sync clear operation to other users
  if (socket && roomId) {
    console.log('Syncing clear canvas operation:', { roomId });
    setTimeout(() => {
      socket.emit('whiteboard-update', { 
        lines: [], 
        textBoxes: [], 
        shapes: [], 
        roomId 
      });
      // Reset the flags after sync
      setTimeout(() => {
        setIsUpdatingFromSocket(false);
        setIsClearing(false);
      }, 300); // Longer delay to ensure clear operation is processed
    }, 200);
  } else {
    setIsUpdatingFromSocket(false);
    setIsClearing(false);
  }
  
  saveState();
}, [saveState, socket, roomId]);
```

### **3. Prevented Conflicting Syncs:**
- **useEffect sync**: Added `!isClearing` condition
- **debouncedSaveState**: Added `!isClearing` condition  
- **saveState**: Added `|| isClearing` condition to prevent execution

### **4. Enhanced Socket Event Handling:**
```javascript
if (isClearOperation) {
  console.log('Processing clear operation from socket');
  // For clear operations, apply immediately without delay
  setLines([]);
  setTextBoxes([]);
  setShapes([]);
  setIsUpdatingFromSocket(false);
  setIsClearing(false); // Reset clearing flag
}
```

### **5. Improved Undo/Redo Operations:**
- Added `setIsClearing(false)` to ensure we're not in clearing mode
- Better coordination with clear operations

## How to Test:

1. **Refresh both browser tabs** to get the latest code
2. **Join the same room** in both tabs
3. **Test permanent delete:**

### **Clear Canvas Testing:**
- Draw some shapes and text in both tabs
- Click the trash/delete icon in one tab
- Canvas should clear **permanently** in both tabs
- **Content should NOT come back** after 2 seconds

### **Undo/Redo Testing:**
- Draw some content in one tab
- Use undo in one tab - should undo in both tabs
- Use redo in one tab - should redo in both tabs
- **No conflicts** with clear operations

## Expected Results:
- ✅ **Clear canvas works permanently** - content stays deleted
- ✅ **No content restoration** after 2 seconds
- ✅ **All sync mechanisms respect clear operations**
- ✅ **Undo/redo operations work properly** without conflicts

## Debug Information:
Check browser console for:
- "Syncing clear canvas operation: {roomId: 'test123'}"
- "Processing clear operation from socket"
- No conflicting "Whiteboard state changed - syncing" messages during clear

## Key Improvements:
1. **Added `isClearing` flag** to prevent all conflicting syncs
2. **Longer delay (300ms)** to ensure clear operation is fully processed
3. **Prevented all debounced syncs** during clear operations
4. **Enhanced flag management** across all operations

The delete/clear canvas operation should now work **permanently** without any content restoration!
